rails.vim tip
--------------

:Rails!			Show the version of rails.vim installed.  If rails.vim
			is active for the current buffer, also show the type
			of Rails file detected.

:Redit {file}		Edit {file}, relative to the application root.  Append
			:line or #method to jump within the file, as in
			:Redit app/controllers/users_controller.rb:12 or
			:Redit app/models/user.rb#activate .

:Rfind [{file}]		Find {file}.  Very similar to :find, but things like
			BlogController are properly handled, and tab complete
			works.
